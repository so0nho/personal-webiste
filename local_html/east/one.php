        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East">
        <p>East is the direction toward which the Earth rotates about its axis, and 
        therefore the general direction from which the Sun appears to rise. The 
        practice of praying towards the East is older than Christianity, but has 
        been adopted by this religion as the Orient was thought of as containing 
        mankind's original home. Hence, some Christian churches have been traditionally 
        oriented towards the east. This tradition of having the altar on the 
        liturgical east is a part of the church orientation concept liturgical east and west.</p>
       
        <p>The Orient is the East, traditionally comprising anything that belongs to the 
        Eastern world, in relation to Europe. In English, it is largely a metonym for, 
        and referring to the same area as, the continent of Asia, divided into the 
        Far East, Middle East, and Near East. Despite this Eurocentric origin, these 
        regions are still located to the east of the Geographical centre of Earth.</p>
        
        <p>Within an individual city, the east end is typically poorer because the 
        prevailing winds blow from the west.</p>
