    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Place a roasting rack on a foil-lined 
            baking sheet in the oven. </li>
        <li>Using your hands, break the meat into small pieces and combine evenly but 
            loosely on a parchment or waxed paper-lined baking sheet. Spread the meat 
            out and season it generously with salt and pepper. If desired, add the spice 
            mix at this time. </li>
        <li>Divide the meat into 4 portions (about 6 ounces each). Using your hands, form 
            each portion into a ball-shape by gently tossing it from 1 hand to the other. 
            (Don't over work or press too firmly on the meat.) Gently form each portion into 
            a patty about 3 1/2 inches wide and 1-inch-thick. </li>
        <li> Preheat a large cast iron skillet over medium-low heat for 5 minutes. 
            Raise the heat to high and add the oil. Add the patties and cook, turning once, 
            until well-browned, about 2 minutes each side. </li>
        <li>Using a spatula, transfer the hamburgers to the roasting rack in the oven and 
            continue cooking to desired doneness, 8 to 9 minutes for medium-rare, 10 to 11 minutes 
            for medium, and 13 to 15 minutes for well-done. If you are using the cheese, top the 
            hamburgers during their last couple of minutes of cooking to melt. </li>
        <li>Transfer the hamburgers to a plate, let rest for a couple minutes before serving. 
            Meanwhile, toast the hamburger buns. Assemble the hamburgers with the condiments and 
            toppings of your choice. Serve. </li>
    </ol>
